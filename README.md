# Boost WordPress Speed & Performance
 
What steps we can take to improve the performance of the WP site?
    
    1. Improving Core Web Vitals.
    2. Hosting providers play a major role. For example Dedicated hosting performs best even during peak hours. 
       If your site is on poor hardware, plugins may not be much effective. 
    3. Caching Plugin: I have used WP-Rocket and a very good free alternative Breeze plugin. 
    4. CDN is an important option. I have personal experience with Cloudflare. It is really good. 
       Free alternative jsDelivr. It's open source. 
    5. Use Query Monitor. This plugin helped me a lot. It helped me identify performance issues in other plugins. 
    6. Compress Media Files: Imagify is a free plugin to compress images. But be careful with it. 
    7. The website and the Database should be in the Same Data Center. Ensure that. 
    8. Minimize or Disable Hotlinking.  
    9. Minify JavaScript and CSS Files
    10.Use Light Weight Theme
    11.Limit Post Revision
    12.Remove Useless Widgets
    13.Reduce as many external HTTP requests as possible
    14.Optimize the WordPress Database
    15.Configure Redis
    16.Host your Google Fonts locally
    17.Paginate Comments
    18.Paginate Long-Form Content
    19.Lazy Load Images: Above plugin can be used. 
    20.Use YouTube or Vimeo for Videos etc.
